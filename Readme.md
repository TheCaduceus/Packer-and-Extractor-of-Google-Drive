<h4><b>1.Every Variable used in this NoteBook is Highlighted with "Yellow" colour.</b></h4>
<h4><b>2.Some Scripts are added to solve Input error caused by user like not entering .zip or .tar while packing.</b></h4>
<h4><b>3.While packing anything in (.RAR) there is no need to put .rar because package will automatically put it.</b></h4>
<h4><b>4.If user do not provide or do a mistake in format while packing then alogorithm will try the same with "Filename" or "Filename.format"</b></h4>
<h4><b>5.While unpacking (.RAR), User needs to enter Password after running the Code.</b></h4>
<h4><b>6.Making password protected (.RAR), User needs to enter Password after running the Code.</b></h4>
<h4><b>7.Time of Packing or Unpacking depends upon the size of the File or Folder.</b></h4>
<h4><b>8.No risk of Data Corruption.</b></h4>
<h4><b>9.Google will not able to Flag a copyright file if you pack it into .RAR with password.</b></h4>
<h4><b>10.Don't forget to remember the password set by you while packing anything.</b></h4>
<h4><b>11.You can Keep Final OUTPUT File/Folder at Same Shared Drive also! Just keep "SHARED DRIVE NAME1" and "SHARED DRIVE NAME2" same.</b></h4>
<h2>üó≥Ô∏èOptimization</h2>
<h4><b>1.This Google Colab NoteBook (Jupyter's NoteBook) comes with some optimizations which are added to fix some common mistakes caused by Users during INPUT. If a user failed to provide the format of a particular file while packing or unpacking it! Then the System will automatically search or  add the Format to ignore the Error.</b></h4>
<h4><b>2.If User want to Extract a File into a Folder made by user itself then the System will not make the NEW FOLDER (If file is too small otherwise it will).But in opposite condition! The System will make the Folder of File's name.</b></h4>
<h4><b>3.Using GPU as a RUNTIME TYPE can increase the Speed of Process.</b></h4>
<h2> üîê Safe or Not? ‚úÖ</h2>
<h4><b> 1.Don't Worry! No data will be shared with anyone, if you use the <a href="https://github.com/TheCaduceus/Packer-and-Extractor-of-Google-Drive">Original code</a>.üîí</b></h4>
<h4><b> 2.This will not cause any type of Data corruption!üîë</b></h4>
<h4><b> 3.Do not trust any other copy of this Code.üìö</b></h4>
<h2> ü§î Why Use This?</h2>
<h4><b>1.Sometimes the Google Flag some of your copyright file and make it unusable but by packing it into .RAR or .Zip them Google will not able to read it and hence you can store it and share it without any problem of account termination.</b></h4>
<h4><b>2.Also before downloading anything you can check what is inside of that package. You can share a particular file of the Zip directly now!</b></h4>
<h4><b>3.And If you use Google Collab for Long term use, then you can understand that it requires Human Interaction atleast one time per 90 Minutes! Otherwise it will cancel the task and all your Work will got failed! But this Repository comes with the code which prevent this.</b></h4>
<h4><b>4.Sometimes the Users found to handle Google Colab defficult so we have designed a Simple and Advanced UI for them.</b></h4>
<h4><b>5.We update every Repository on a regular Basis and fix Problems reported to us by our Users!</b></h4>
