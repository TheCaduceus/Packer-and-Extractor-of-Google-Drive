# **Advanced Knowledge**
**To pack all data of a particular Shared Drive into a particular Format then just use the below code as the source**
```
/gdrive/Shared drives/SHARED DRIVE NAME1/ # Source
```
**and**
```
/gdrive/Shared drives/SHARED DRIVE NAME2/ # Destination
```
**For My Drive as Source or Destination**
```
/gdrive/My Drive/ # Source or Destination
```
**For Selecting particular File in My Drive you can type its name with format but not in some cases**
```
/gdrive/My Drive/File_Name.format # Format like (.mp3/.mp4/.pdf/.mkv/.json)
```
**Now don't take it lazy because even removing ```/``` from ```/gdrive``` will going to disrupt whole program and sometimes writing ```.zip``` or ```.rar``` during processes can trigger an Error, However system is also going to help out user by solving INPUT Error automatically.**
